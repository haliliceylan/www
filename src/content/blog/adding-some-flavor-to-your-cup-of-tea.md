_A year ago, we brewed the first cup of tea. Now, it’s time to add some honey to the mix._

Introducing [tea’s Graphical User Interface (GUI)](https://www.producthunt.com/products/tea) — the latest addition to the revolutionary tea package management system developed by the creator of Homebrew. The tea GUI is set to change the way developers approach package management by making it more accessible, secure, and intuitive.

Package managers are the backbone of every tech stack, yet they haven’t evolved in decades. tea is here to change that. With the introduction of the tea GUI, developers can now visually browse a package manager through a front-end, and install packages without navigating the CLI. They will soon be able to review packages for the first time, as well. Developers can also brand their creations through the tea GUI, adding to their packages’ visibility.

**So what is tea, and why is the tea GUI necessary?** Tea is a next-generation package manager that provides developers with intuitive solutions to optimize their output while saving them time and effort. Tea automatically identifies and changes the versions necessary for different projects, cutting down on manual input previously required from developers. Furthermore, tea automatically manages dependencies, removing burdensome mapping requirements from contributors.

The tea GUI is necessary for two main reasons: _security_ and _user experience_. There are many security vulnerabilities when installing and running new packages due to a lack of infrastructure around the building and maintenance of open-source software. For example, a newer package might not have been sufficiently tested, and it might make whatever is built on top of it vulnerable to malicious attacks. With the tea GUI, users can test and review packages, ensuring that they can trust the packages they are installing into their computers.

Experienced developers may be familiar with installing dependencies, changing versions, and dealing with prerequisites for building software. However, those who don’t code regularly may find these requirements complex and difficult to navigate, which can make the development process less equitable (and pleasant). With the tea GUI, the complexities of package management are significantly decreased, making it more accessible to developers of all skill levels.

The tea GUI is set to revolutionize the way developers approach package management. From the creator of Homebrew, tea is bringing a new horizon to open-source development: one that is equitable, intuitive, and magical. Add some flavor to your cup of tea and try out the tea GUI today.
