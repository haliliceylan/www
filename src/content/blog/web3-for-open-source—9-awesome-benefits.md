# Web3 For Open Source—9 Awesome Benefits

Because you deserve to get paid.

## TL;DR

- Web3 solves key pain points for open-source developers

- Open-source software can be improved by blockchain tech

- Open source + web3 = ❤️

Does cryptocurrency sound like a dirty word?

Open-source developers have been toiling away in obscurity at unpaid passion projects since the dawn of the internet, without the interference from Bitcoin or any other digital currency. The crypto craze may feel like a distraction, or worse, a scam.

Web3 technologies are built on the same principles of decentralization and peer-to-peer networking that characterize open-source development. Being skeptical of new tech is relatable—but blockchain technology can confer many important benefits to open-source software and the open-source community.

Let’s check out nine of these key benefits right now.

## 1. Own and control your work

Decentralized technology enables developers to establish clear ownership rights over their projects. Developers can retain full control over their code and contributions to a project—without being subject to any restrictions by a centralized platform.

Software developers can tokenize their projects to establish project ownership and distribute project value. Tokenizing a project means creating a blockchain-based digital asset that represents a project’s ownership and worth.

Developers leveraging web3 typically use smart contracts—code-based contracts that can execute automatically—to steward ownership over their work. Open-source developers can also use web3 to create decentralized repositories that are fully owned and controlled by a repository’s contributors.

Another key benefit of a web3 protocol is that it provides protection against unwanted takeovers of open-source projects. Communities of contributors can sleep well at night knowing that they are safe from hostile actions by external parties.

## 2. Get paid

Web3 technology can address the biggest pain point for open-source developers—getting paid. Open-source infrastructure plays a critical role in running the internet, yet open-source developers are overwhelmingly not compensated for their contributions.

Web3 can fix that! Blockchain technology supports incentive layers, introducing new mechanisms that enable developers to directly monetize their work. Open-source developers are using web3 to facilitate the equitable and transparent distribution of profits among contributors.

Let’s take a look at all the ways that open-source developers can benefit financially by using a web3 protocol:

- **Incentivize contributions:** Developers can be rewarded with project tokens for their contributions to an open-source project. Bounties can be set for specific tasks or initiatives.

- **Implement profit-sharing protocols:** An open-source project can use smart contracts to automatically distribute profits among contributors based on predefined parameters.

- **Support a marketplace:** Development projects that are tokenized on a blockchain can create a marketplace for the exchange of project tokens. A token-based marketplace enables project value to be traded or sold.

- **Support paywalls and subscription models:** Smart contracts enable open-source developers to establish paywalls or subscription services to monetize their software projects.

- **Sell licensing agreements:** Smart contracts can support licensing agreements, with the terms of an agreement published to and secured by a blockchain.

Web3 protocols enable more contributors around the world to be paid for their additions to an open-source project. Digital currencies readily support cross-border payments and can potentially democratize developers’ access to monetization opportunities. An open-source project using blockchain ledger technology can transparently track revenue and profit distribution.

## 3. Collaborate better

Web3 supports decentralized development environments that can improve collaboration among open-source developers. Blockchain tech enables knowledge to be efficiently shared, perhaps unlocking technological breakthroughs or other untapped creativity.  

How exactly does web3 enable high-quality collaboration in the open-source community? Let’s delve in:  

- **Everyone’s invited:** Web3 protocols support broad community involvement by encouraging developers everywhere to share ideas, code, and expertise.

- **No barriers to entry:** Third-party approvals are a relic of the past in decentralized development environments.

- **No censorship:** Uncensored discussions and feedback are the norm in web3-based development environments.

- **Real-time collaboration:** Decentralized web3 platforms can support seamless collaboration in real time to improve productivity among open-source developers.   

- **Peer-to-peer collaboration:** Open-source developers can use web3 protocols to work directly with their peers, eliminating any need for a centralized platform or intermediary.

- **No secrets:** Web3's transparent nature builds trust and facilitates open collaboration. All collaborative actions, decisions, and transactions can be recorded on a blockchain.

## 4. Leverage the power of community

Web3 technologies empower open-source communities by putting community at the center of the development of a project. The decentralized nature of Web3 enables a democratic approach to the governance of an open-source project. A technology that’s developed under the auspices of web3 governance is well positioned to benefit every project contributor.

Open-source development projects using web3 governance are typically structured as DAOs—decentralized autonomous organizations. DAOs enable project contributors to submit and vote on proposals, influence funding allocations, and otherwise participate in decision making. The influence of a contributor is generally proportional to the number of project tokens they own.

An open-source community using web3 can decentralize many aspects of a project—

- Standards and protocol development

- Creation and distribution of documentation

- Development of adaptive and responsive security policies

- Communication among contributors

- Decision making

An empowered community is an engaged community. Web3 tools and platforms can foster deep, meaningful engagement to create a sense of shared purpose and vision among a project’s developers.

## 5. Increase standardization and interoperability

Web3 technology supports the development of shared standards and interoperable systems. The open and collaborative nature of blockchain dev environments enables developers to propose standards, debate them, and eventually adopt the same or similar standards across various technology platforms.

Standardization using web3 can improve the compatibility of interfaces, whether for crypto-native applications like smart contracts or the programs that bring open-source developers together. Web3 can support the creation of standardized documentation and educational materials, in addition to standardized developer toolkits and frameworks. Widely standardized security protocols across open-source projects are also possible using web3.

Which specific components of web3 tech are driving increased platform interoperability and widespread standards adoption? Let’s get a little technical:

- **Composable smart contracts:** The composable nature of smart contracts helps developers to create code that can easily interact, fostering code reusability.

- **Cross-chain bridges:** Cross-chain bridges are a blockchain innovation that allow smart contracts to communicate across different chains, expanding the creative possibilities for software developers.

- **Decentralized data exchanges:** The rise of data exchange platforms that are decentralized increase interoperability among disparate development projects.

- **Decentralized oracles:** Using a decentralized oracle service provides credible, real-time information in a standard format to communities of software developers.

- **Decentralized data marketplaces:** Marketplaces that support the decentralized sharing and sale of data support the development of standardized data formats and protocols.

- **Interoperable identity solutions:** Web3 enables standardized identity solutions that can be used across different applications and development projects.

## 6. Innovate faster

Open-source communities that embrace web3 are learning how to innovate faster. Decentralized development environments are fundamentally changing how software developers approach projects, enabling dev communities to efficiently share valuable knowledge, insights, and experience. Developers using web3 can have expansive freedom to experiment, innovate, and implement novel tech solutions.

How is web3 driving this accelerated rate of progress? Let’s get down into the weeds:

Technologies using cryptographic methods can potentially stave off even sophisticated attacks that use quantum computing power. A decentralized group of developers using web3 protocols can be difficult to target or hack because the organization lacks a centralized authority.

Let’s examine some specific ways that web3 is improving the security of developer environments:

- Web3 eliminates single points of failure

- Blockchain-based records are immutable

- Decentralized identity verification is possible using web3

- Blockchain technology can support digital signatures

- Web3 supports robust encryption and verification mechanisms

- Web3 protocols can establish secure communication channels

- Decentralized technology projects are generally resistant to unwanted takeovers

Blockchain tech is lauded for being exceptionally secure, and it can also protect user privacy. Permissioned blockchains may set customized user privileges, and blockchain developers can incorporate zero-knowledge proofs—enabling users to prove possession of information without revealing the information itself.

## 8. Access new funding sources

Open-source developers can use web3 to access creative sources of capital. Web3 and open-source development are both synonymous with community, which can be leveraged to generate crowd-sourced funding. A technology development project that’s structured as a DAO and tokenized is well positioned to accept funding from a decentralized network of sources.  

Web3 can help developer communities to meet their funding needs in a variety of innovative ways. Here’s what web3 is already supporting:

- **DAO-led investments:** A decentralized autonomous organization with an investment mandate can collectively decide to invest in one or more promising technology projects.

- **Decentralized crowdfunding platforms:** Crowdfunding platforms that are decentralized enable open-source developers to directly pitch projects to potential supporters. Web3 crowdfunding eliminates the involvement of any third-party intermediary.

- **Decentralized grant platforms:** Web3 grant-making functions much like decentralized crowdfunding, except that capital providers aren’t expecting a financial return. The members of a DAO can collectively determine how grant monies are distributed.  

- **Initial DEX offerings:** Open-source projects that are tokenized can launch their tokens on a decentralized exchange or DEX—this type of capital raise is known as an initial DEX offering.

- **Community sponsorship programs:** Project token holders or DAO members can sponsor specific initiatives within a tech development project based on their personal passions or interests.

The inclusive nature of web3 enables more people from places everywhere to fund projects that matter to them. Web3 can potentially aggregate large pools of capital, which can be allocated to promising projects regardless of their size. Small open-source projects and individual developers can potentially use web3 to access funding more easily.

## 9. Work on what you love

Web3 can be the catalyst that enables open-source developers to achieve full autonomy and work only on what they love. Open source and web3 already share many of the same values—prizing openness, collaboration, and shared ownership—but creating open-source software typically doesn’t pay the bills. Web3 provides a crucial incentive layer that can empower talented developers to forge their own paths.
